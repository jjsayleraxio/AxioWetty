web terminal container used by Axio Research
## How To Use:
Run the following line of code in a terminal:
```
docker run -dit --init --name=[NAME] --hostname=[HOSTNAME] -p [PORT]:3000 -p [PORT]:8050 -v [HOST]:[CONTAINER] jjsaxio/axio_wetty:dev
```

Code Breakdown:

* ```--init``` is required. Starts an init process. This is very important or your container will never close any processes and become overrun with orphan processes.
* ```--name=[NAME]``` is optional. Gives container a name
* ```--hostname=[HOSTNAME]``` is optional. Gives container a friendly hostname that is seen when logging into the weTTY
* ```-p [PORT]:3000``` and ```-p [PORT]:8050``` are required. These bind container ports to whatever you want on the host. Port 3000 in container is for weTTY and port 8050 in container is to display web pages generated by flask.
* ```-v [HOST]:[CONTAINER]``` is also optional. This binds a volumne (folder) on host with a folder on container. You can have as many of these as needed.
